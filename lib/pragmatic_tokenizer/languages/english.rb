      # N.B. Some English contractions are ambigous (i.e. "she's" can mean "she has" or "she is").
      # Pragmatic Tokenizer will return the most frequently appearing expanded contraction. Regardless, this should
      # be rather insignificant as in most cases one is probably removing stop words.
