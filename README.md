# Pragmatic Tokenizer

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pragmatic_tokenizer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pragmatic_tokenizer) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/giovannelli/pragmatic_tokenizer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/giovannelli/pragmatic_tokenizer) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_tokenizer/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

Pragmatic Tokenizer is a multilingual tokenizer to split a string into tokens.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

**Ruby**  
```
gem install pragmatic_tokenizer
```

**Ruby on Rails**  
Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:  
```ruby 
gem 'pragmatic_tokenizer'
```

## Usage

* If no language is specified, the library will default to English.   
* To specify a language use its two character [ISO 639-1 code](https://www.tm-town.com/languages).
* Pragmatic Tokenizer will unescape any HTML entities.

**Example Usage**
```ruby
text = "\"I said, 'what're you? Crazy?'\" said Sandowsky. \"I can't afford to do that.\""

PragmaticTokenizer::Tokenizer.new.tokenize(text)
# => ["\"", "i", "said", ",", "'", "what're", "you", "?", "crazy", "?", "'", "\"", "said", "sandowsky", ".", "\"", "i", "can't", "afford", "to", "do", "that", ".", "\""]

# You can pass many different options to #initialize:
options = {
  language:            :en, # the language of the string you are tokenizing
  abbreviations:       ['a.b', 'a'], # a user-supplied array of abbreviations (downcased with ending period removed)
  stop_words:          ['is', 'the'], # a user-supplied array of stop words (downcased)
  remove_stop_words:   true, # remove stop words
  contractions:        { "i'm" => "i am" }, # a user-supplied hash of contractions (key is the contracted form; value is the expanded form - both the key and value should be downcased)
  expand_contractions: true, # (i.e. ["isn't"] will change to two tokens ["is", "not"])
  filter_languages:    [:en, :de], # process abbreviations, contractions and stop words for this array of languages
  punctuation:         :none, # see below for more details
  numbers:             :none, # see below for more details
  remove_emoji:        :true, # remove any emoji tokens
  remove_urls:         :true, # remove any urls
  remove_emails:       :true, # remove any emails
  remove_domains:      :true, # remove any domains
  hashtags:            :keep_and_clean, # remove the hastag prefix
  mentions:            :keep_and_clean, # remove the @ prefix
  clean:               true, # remove some special characters
  classic_filter:      true, # removes dots from acronyms and 's from the end of tokens
  downcase:            false, # do not downcase tokens
  minimum_length:      3, # remove any tokens less than 3 characters
  long_word_split:     10 # split tokens longer than 10 characters at hypens or underscores
}
```

**Options**  

##### `language`
  **default** = `'en'`
- To specify a language use its two character [ISO 639-1 code](https://www.tm-town.com/languages) as a symbol (i.e. `:en`) or string (i.e. `'en'`)

<hr>

##### `abbreviations`
  **default** = `nil`

<hr>

##### `stop_words`
  **default** = `nil`
- You can pass an array of stop words to overide or compliment the stop words that come stored in this gem. Each element of the array should be a downcased String.

<hr>

##### `contractions`
  **default** = `nil`
- You can pass a hash of contractions to overide or compliment the contractions that come stored in this gem. Each key is the contracted form downcased and each value is the expanded form downcased.

##### `remove_stop_words`
  **default** = `false`
- `true`

If you supply your own abbreviations, stop words or contractions they will be merged with the abbreviations, stop words and contractions of any languages you add in this option. You can pass an array of symbols or strings (i.e. `[:en, :de]` or `['en', 'de']`)

<hr>
